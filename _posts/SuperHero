In this post, I wanted to show off the product of a [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/superhero-tensorflow) Guided Project ([Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/56YBSC92KTYX?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=project)), in which I used TensorFlow to initiate a deep learning model to create a name generator for super heroes based on a training set of prepopulated super hero names. Though some of the results might not be satisfying super hero monikers, it was a great chance to go one step beyond the walkthrough and practice launching an app from the developed model utilizing Streamlit.
