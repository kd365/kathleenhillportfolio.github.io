This project was completed as a requirement for the AIT 722: Theories and Models in Geo-Social Data Analytics course at George Mason University. Future plans for this project include applying a risk value for each park in Washington DC according to crime and traffic safety metrics, as well as the development of an application for parents to search for the safest playgrounds in their vicinity. See the website below for the final project pages.
